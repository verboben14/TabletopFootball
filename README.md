# TabletopFootball
A tabletop football game made in WPF for a school project.

This project was inspired by an old game we used to play with my brother.
The players cannot actually move in the original game, only tilt on a spring. It is played with a small ball which travels from player to player until it's scored.
Both keepers can be moved on a line with a handle on the side.

It is a 1-on-1 game which is played mostly with a mouse and keyboard combinations for the keepers of each players.
In my game the players can be moved in a circle around each, the keeper can be moved on a line with the cursor buttons.
The speed of the ball depends on the distance between the player and the ball when the mouse button is released.

There might be bugs in the gameplay, I plan on fixing them in the future.
The code is currently Hungarian because it was the requirement in my school, I will change it to English if I have the time.
